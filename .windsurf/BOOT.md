# LDC Tools - Windsurf Boot Context

**App:** LDC Construction Tools  
**Port:** 3001  
**Containers:** ldc-staging (135), ldc-prod (133)

## Quick Reference

**Verify LIVE/STANDBY:**
```bash
.cloudy-work/_cloudy-ops/scripts/verify-live-standby.sh ldctools

```bash
ssh ldc-staging  # STANDBY (typically)

- ✅ Local Mac is for Windsurf IDE and git operations only
