## Quality Assurance Coordination

### SDD Module Testing
- Ensure all 7 pending modules meet quality gates (>90% test coverage)
- Coordinate API response time validation (<200ms P95)
- Monitor security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Validate OpenAPI contract compliance

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor WMACS credit usage and budget adherence
- Track deployment cycle efficiency (target: 6.5 credits/cycle)
- Validate performance budgets (Bundle <200KB, Memory <256MB)
- Coordinate performance optimization interventions

### Integration Testing
- Coordinate testing between modular components
- Ensure seamless integration across all SDD modules
- Validate end-to-end workflows for Personnel Contact operations
- Monitor cross-module communication and data flow

## Intervention Protocols

### Level 1: Automatic Recovery
