# LDC Tools Version Bump Workflow

When the user says "bump" for LDC Tools, follow this complete workflow.

## Infrastructure Context

**LDC Tools Blue-Green Setup:**
- **BLUE (Container 133):** 10.92.3.23:3001 - Currently PRODUCTION
- **GREEN (Container 135):** 10.92.3.25:3001 - Currently STANDBY
- **Database (Container 131):** 10.92.3.21 - Shared
- **HAProxy (Container 136):** Routes ldctools.com traffic
- **Repository:** `/opt/ldc-construction-tools`
- **Branch:** `feature/app-rename-and-nextauth-v4` (will merge to main)

## Step 1: Analyze Recent Changes

Review recent commits to understand what changed:
```bash
cd /Users/cory/Documents/Cloudy-Work/applications/ldc-construction-tools
git log --oneline -10
```

Identify:
- New features added
- Bug fixes
- UI changes
- API changes
- Configuration changes

## Step 2: Determine Version Type

Based on changes, decide version bump:
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, major architecture changes
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, new user-facing functionality
- **PATCH** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, small improvements, documentation only

## Step 3: **CRITICAL - Analyze Help Documentation Needs**

### Automatic Analysis Questions:

**Ask yourself for EACH change:**

1. **Is this visible to users?**
   - New UI elements, pages, or features?
   - Changed workflows or processes?
   - New admin capabilities?
   ‚Üí If YES: Help documentation likely needed

2. **Does this change how users do something?**
   - Modified existing features?
   - New steps in existing workflows?
   - Changed behavior?
   ‚Üí If YES: Update existing help pages

3. **Will users have questions about this?**
   - Complex new feature?
   - Non-obvious functionality?
   - Requires explanation?
   ‚Üí If YES: Add FAQ section or new help page

4. **Is this admin-only?**
   - Admin portal features?
   - System management?
   - Configuration?
   ‚Üí If YES: Create admin-restricted help page

### Help Documentation Decision Matrix:

| Change Type | Help Action Required |
|-------------|---------------------|
| New user-facing feature | Create new help page + add to index |
| Modified existing feature | Update relevant help page |
| Bug fix (no UI change) | No help update needed |
| Admin feature | Create admin help page |
| New workflow/process | Document step-by-step |
| UI redesign | Update screenshots/descriptions |

### If Help Documentation Needed:

**Create Help Page:**
- Location: `/frontend/src/app/help/[feature-name]/page.tsx`
- Use existing help pages as template (getting-started, authentication)
- Include: Overview, How-to, FAQ
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Add emojis for visual clarity
- Set proper role restrictions
- Add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

**Update Help Index:**
- Edit `/frontend/src/app/help/page.tsx`
- Add to `helpTopics` array
- Set appropriate roles array
- Use descriptive title and description

**Content Guidelines:**
- Write for end-users, not developers
- Step-by-step instructions
- Include "What you'll see" descriptions
- Add common questions section
- Explain WHY not just HOW

## Step 4: Update Version Number

Edit `frontend/package.json`:
```json
"version": "X.Y.Z"
```

Also update version in:
- `/frontend/src/components/HelpLayout.tsx` (line 17: `const version = 'X.Y.Z'`)
- `/frontend/src/components/ConditionalLayout.tsx` (footer version)

## Step 5: Create User-Friendly Release Notes

Create `/frontend/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md` with frontmatter:

**Template:**
```markdown
---
version: X.Y.Z
date: YYYY-MM-DD
type: major|minor|patch
title: Brief User-Friendly Title
description: One sentence describing the main focus of this release
---

## ‚ú® New Features (if any)

- **Feature Name** - Brief description of what users can now do
- **Another Feature** - How this benefits users

## üêõ Bug Fixes (if any)

- **Fixed [issue]** - Describe what was broken and is now fixed
- **Resolved [problem]** - User-facing description of the fix

## üîß Improvements (if any)

- **Better [thing]** - How the experience is improved
- **Enhanced [feature]** - What's better for users

## üîê Security (if any)

- **Security Enhancement** - What security improvement was made
- **Updated Dependencies** - Security patches applied

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes (if any - rare!)

- **[Change]** - What changed and what users need to do
- **Action Required** - Clear steps for users to take

## üìù Notes (optional)

- Additional context or information users should know
- Migration notes if applicable
- Known limitations or workarounds
```

**Release Notes Rules:**
- NO technical jargon
- NO code references
- NO implementation details
- NO IP addresses or container numbers
- Focus on user benefits
- Clear, simple language
- Examples when helpful
- Follow TEMPLATE.md guidelines

## Step 6: Update CHANGELOG.md

Update `/CHANGELOG.md` with technical details:
```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Technical feature descriptions

### Changed
- What changed technically

### Fixed
- Bug fixes with technical context

### Security
- Security updates
```

## Step 7: Commit Everything

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z - [Brief Description]

[Detailed commit message with changes]

[If help docs added: mention it]"
git push origin feature/app-rename-and-nextauth-v4
```

## Step 8: Deploy to STANDBY (Container 135 - GREEN)

Deploy to STANDBY environment for testing:
```bash
# Deploy to GREEN (STANDBY)
ssh prox "pct exec 135 -- bash -c 'cd /opt/ldc-construction-tools && git pull origin feature/app-rename-and-nextauth-v4 && cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build && pm2 restart ldc-production --update-env'"
```

## Step 9: Test on STANDBY

Test the new version:
- URL: `https://green.ldctools.com`
- Verify all changes work
- Check help pages if added
- Review release notes display
- Test user workflows

## Step 10: Report and Wait for Approval

**DO NOT auto-release!** Report to user:

```
‚úÖ vX.Y.Z Ready for Release

Version: X.Y.Z
STANDBY: https://green.ldctools.com
PROD: https://ldctools.com (still on vX.Y.Z-1)

Changes:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

Help Documentation:
- [Created/Updated/None needed]

Ready to release when you approve!
```

## Step 11: Release (Only After Approval)

User will say "release" - then:
1. Update HAProxy to route to GREEN
2. **STOP and report success**
3. **ASK: "Ready to sync BLUE (new STANDBY)?"**
4. **WAIT for approval**
5. Only sync after explicit approval
