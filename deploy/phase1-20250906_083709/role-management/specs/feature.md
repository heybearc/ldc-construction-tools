## Overview
The Role Management module provides comprehensive functionality for managing organizational roles within LDC Construction Tools, supporting both regional and project-specific role assignments.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Display user and role assignment views
- [ ] Support regional vs project-specific role distinction
- [ ] Manage role assignments with proper scoping
- [ ] Provide role statistics and reporting
- [ ] Export role assignment data
- [ ] Support role hierarchy and permissions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Response time < 200ms for role queries
- [ ] Support up to 1000 concurrent users
- [ ] 99.9% uptime availability
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Audit trail for all role changes

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/v1/role-assignments - List role assignments
- POST /api/v1/role-assignments - Create role assignment
- PUT /api/v1/role-assignments/{id} - Update role assignment
- DELETE /api/v1/role-assignments/{id} - Remove role assignment
- GET /api/v1/role-assignments/stats - Get role statistics
- GET /api/v1/role-assignments/health - Health check

## Components
- RoleManagementComponent - Main dashboard component
- UserRolesView - Display users with their roles
- RoleAssignmentsView - Display roles organized by type
- RoleStatsComponent - Statistics and metrics display

## Data Models
- User: Basic user information
- Role: Role definition with type and scope
- RoleAssignment: Assignment of role to user with context
- RoleStats: Statistical information about role usage

## Dependencies
- User management system
- Authentication/authorization service
- Database for role persistence
- Export service for data extraction

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for API layer (>90% coverage)
- Integration tests for database operations
- Component tests for React components
- E2E tests for complete role assignment workflows
- Performance tests for concurrent usage
- Security tests for authorization

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Data isolation between organizational units
- Audit logging for compliance
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against privilege escalation

## Performance Requirements
- Role queries: < 100ms response time
- Role assignment operations: < 200ms
- Statistics generation: < 500ms
- Export operations: < 5 seconds for up to 10,000 records
- Memory usage: < 100MB per module instance

## Deployment
- Module deployed as part of main application
- Database migrations for role schema
- Configuration for role types and scopes
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Monitoring & Observability
- Health check endpoint
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring
- User activity tracking
- Resource utilization metrics
