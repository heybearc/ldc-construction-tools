   - Passwords never stored in plain text

3. **Better Session Management**
   - JWT tokens instead of custom cookies
   - Automatic session expiration

## 📦 What Was Removed

**Removed Files:**
- `frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts`
- Custom session cookie management

**Why?**
- Hardcoded credentials were a security risk
