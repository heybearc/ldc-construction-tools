**US LDC Structure**:
- **5 Zones** across the United States
- **12 Regions per Zone** (60 total regions)
- **Per Region**: 1 Construction Group, 1 Personnel Contact, 1 Field Rep
- **Each role** has associated teams (to be defined in future phases)

- **Database Schema**: Add `zone_id` and `region_id` fields to all core entities
- **User Authentication**: Region-scoped user access and permissions
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of data between regions
- **Regional Administration**: Self-service admin capabilities per region
- **Zone-Level Oversight**: Aggregated reporting and oversight across regions
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Support for 60 concurrent regional deployments

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. **Phase 1-2**: Develop and perfect single-region functionality (Zone 1 Region 12)
2. **Phase 3**: Implement multi-tenancy architecture before full production
3. **Phase 4**: Gradual rollout to additional regions with zone-level coordination

**Benefits**:
- **Standardization**: Consistent tools and processes across all US LDC regions
- **Efficiency**: Centralized development with regional customization
- **Oversight**: Zone-level visibility and coordination capabilities
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed for 60-region deployment from inception

## Conclusion

This specification provides a comprehensive framework for developing digital tools to support Personnel Contacts in LDC Zone 1 Region 12, with built-in scalability for nationwide deployment. The system will significantly improve volunteer coordination efficiency, enhance communication workflows, and provide valuable insights for Construction Group operations.

The phased implementation approach ensures manageable development cycles while delivering immediate value to Personnel Contacts and the broader construction organization. The zone.region multi-tenancy architecture ensures the system can scale to support all 60 US LDC regions without major architectural refactoring.
