**Purpose**: Simple, effective workflow for managing bugs and improvements  
**Updated**: 2025-09-24

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO WITH ISSUE INFORMATION

### 📝 1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
When you identify a bug or improvement:

#### For Bugs 🐛
1. **Document in ISSUE_TRACKING.md** using the bug template
2. **Assign priority** based on impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. **Add to appropriate module section**
4. **Estimate effort** required for resolution
5. **Assign to team member** if known

#### For Improvements 🚀
1. **Document in ISSUE_TRACKING.md** using the feature template
2. **Evaluate business value** and priority
3. **Add to feature request section**
4. **Consider for next development cycle**

### 📊 2. WEEKLY REVIEW PROCESS

#### Every Monday - Issue Triage
1. **Review new issues** added since last week
2. **Reassess priorities** based on current needs
3. **Assign or reassign** team members
4. **Update status** of in-progress items
5. **Plan work** for the upcoming week

#### Every Friday - Progress Review
1. **Update issue status** for completed work
2. **Document lessons learned** from resolved issues
3. **Identify blockers** and dependencies
4. **Prepare report** for stakeholders

### 🔄 3. INTEGRATION WITH DEVELOPMENT

#### Git Integration
- **Branch naming**: `bugfix/BUG-001-api-integration` or `feature/FEAT-003-email-notifications`
- **Commit messages**: Include issue number (e.g., "Fix BUG-001: Implement backend API integration")
- **Pull requests**: Reference issue number in description

#### Documentation Updates
- **Update ISSUE_TRACKING.md** when status changes
- **Update ADMIN_MODULE_STATUS.md** when modules are affected
- **Create deployment notes** for resolved issues

## 🎯 DECISION MATRIX

### 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ACTION
- **System broken** or **security vulnerability**
- **Blocking deployment** or **preventing core functionality**
- **Action**: Drop everything, fix immediately
- **Timeline**: Same day resolution

### ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY - NEXT SPRINT
- **Significant user impact** or **missing core features**
- **Important for business operations**
- **Action**: Include in next development cycle
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

### 📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY - PLANNED WORK
- **Moderate impact** with **available workarounds**
- **Quality of life improvements**
- **Action**: Add to backlog, plan for future sprints
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

### 💡 LOW PRIORITY - FUTURE CONSIDERATION
- **Minor issues** or **nice-to-have features**
- **Cosmetic improvements**
- **Action**: Document for future consideration
- **Timeline**: When time permits
