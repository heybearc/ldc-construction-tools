## Why Archived?

Per **D-022** (Single Implementation Plan Standard), all planning documentation has been consolidated into a single `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` file at the repository root.

These files represent completed work and historical planning decisions. They are preserved for reference but are no longer active planning documents.
