**Features Ready for Production:**
- ✅ Database schema with 16 trade teams, 40+ crews, 200+ roles
- ✅ Role assignment API endpoints with CRUD operations
- ✅ Basic role management interface
- ✅ Trade team and crew data visualization

**Production Criteria:**
- [ ] All API endpoints return 200 status codes
- [ ] Frontend displays real data from staging database
- [ ] Role assignment CRUD operations work end-to-end
- [ ] No critical bugs in staging for 48+ hours

**Testing Requirements:**
- Database connectivity and data integrity
- API endpoint functionality and error handling  
- Frontend-backend integration
- Basic role assignment workflows

**Production Push Timeline:** End of Week 2

#### **Gate 2: USLDC-2829-E Compliance (Week 3-4)**
**Features Ready for Production:**
- Assignment change tracking with consultation status
- Impact assessment documentation
- Role status management (Remove/Adjust/No Change)
- Assignment category tracking (branch/field appointed)

**Production Criteria:**
- [ ] Consultation workflow tracks properly
- [ ] Assignment changes create audit trail
- [ ] Status updates persist correctly
- [ ] Impact assessment fields capture data

**Testing Requirements:**
- USLDC-2829-E compliance workflow testing
- Assignment change process validation
- Audit trail verification
- Role transition timeline tracking

**Production Push Timeline:** End of Week 4

---

#### **Gate 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)**
**Features Ready for Production:**
- Printable org chart generator (PDF export)
- Complete change history and audit trail
- Vacant position management
- Role assignment statistics and reporting

**Production Criteria:**
- [ ] PDF generation works reliably
- [ ] Export functionality handles all data
- [ ] Reporting provides accurate metrics
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load

**Testing Requirements:**
- PDF generation and export functionality
- Large dataset performance testing
- Report accuracy validation
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Production Push Timeline:** End of Week 6

### **Production Testing Protocol**

#### **Pre-Deployment Validation**
```bash
# 1. Staging Health Check
./scripts/test-role-management.sh

# 2. API Endpoint Testing
curl -f http://10.92.3.25:8000/api/v1/role-assignments/stats/summary
curl -f http://10.92.3.25:8000/api/v1/trade-teams/
curl -f http://10.92.3.25:8000/health

# 3. Frontend Integration Test
curl -f http://10.92.3.25:3001/

# 4. Database Connectivity
ssh prox 'pct exec 131 -- su - postgres -c "psql -d ldc_construction_tools_staging -c \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM role_assignments;\""'
```

#### **Production Deployment Process**
```bash
# 1. Create production database backup
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# 2. Deploy to production with health checks
# (Automated rollback on failure)

# 3. Post-deployment validation
./scripts/test-production.sh
```

#### **Production Health Monitoring**
```bash
# Continuous monitoring checks:
# - API response times < 2 seconds
# - Database query performance
# - Frontend load times
# - Error rate < 1%
# - Uptime > 99.5%
```

### **Feature Release Schedule**

| Week | Staging Development | Production Release | Testing Focus |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | API endpoints + Frontend integration | **Gate 1: Core Role Management** | Basic CRUD, data display |
| 3-4 | USLDC-2829-E compliance workflow | **Gate 2: Compliance Features** | Assignment change tracking |
| 5-6 | Advanced reporting + PDF export | **Gate 3: Advanced Features** | Performance, export functionality |
| 7-8 | Security + Multi-user access | **Gate 4: Production Ready** | Security, user management |

---

### **Production Environment Configuration**

**Infrastructure:**
- **Production Container**: 134 (10.92.3.24)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL Container 131 (10.92.3.21)
- **Production Database**: `ldc_construction_tools_production`

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/rollback-production.sh

# Monitor production health
./scripts/monitor-production.sh
```

**Success Metrics:**
- **Uptime**: >99.5%
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds
- **Error Rate**: <1%
- **User Satisfaction**: >90%

---

### **Risk Management**

**Automated Rollback Triggers:**
- API health check failures
- Database connectivity issues
- Frontend load failures
- Error rate >5% for 5+ minutes

**Manual Intervention Required:**
- Data corruption detected
- Security incidents
- Performance degradation >50%
- User-reported critical bugs

**Backup Strategy:**
- Automated database backups before each deployment
- Configuration snapshots
- Container state preservation
- 30-day backup retention

This strategy ensures reliable, tested deployments with clear gates and automated safety measures.
