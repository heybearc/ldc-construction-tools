## Decision Points for Approval

### ✅ Approve Full Plan (Recommended)
- Complete 16-week development cycle
- All 7 remaining modules implemented
- Full LDC Construction Tools functionality
- Multi-tenancy architecture for scalability

### ⚠️ Approve Phase 2 Only
- 4-week development cycle for core workflow modules
- Assignment Workflow + Calendar Scheduling
- Reassess after Phase 2 completion
- Reduced risk but limited functionality

### ❌ Pause Development
- Focus on optimizing existing 3 modules
- Defer additional module development
- Maintain current functionality level
- Risk of incomplete solution for Personnel Contact needs

## Recommendation

**Approve the full 16-week development plan** to deliver a comprehensive, scalable solution that addresses all Personnel Contact requirements while establishing a robust foundation for nationwide LDC deployment. The SDD modular approach ensures quality, maintainability, and extensibility for long-term success.

The phased approach allows for regular validation and course correction while maintaining momentum toward the complete solution outlined in the original specification.
