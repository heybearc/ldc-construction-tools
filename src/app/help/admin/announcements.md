## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Announcements

✅ **Do:**
- Keep titles short and clear
- Use action-oriented language
- Include specific dates and deadlines
- Provide clear next steps
- Use appropriate urgency levels
- Test with a short message first

❌ **Don't:**
- Overuse urgent announcements
- Write overly long messages
- Leave announcements active indefinitely
- Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Post duplicate announcements
- Forget to set end dates for temporary notices

### Urgency Guidelines

**Use INFO for:**
- General updates and news
- New features or improvements
- Training opportunities
- Helpful tips and reminders

**Use WARNING for:**
- Upcoming maintenance
- Important deadlines
- Policy changes
- Required actions (non-urgent)

**Use URGENT for:**
- System outages
- Emergency situations
- Critical deadlines (today/tomorrow)
- Safety alerts

### Targeting Best Practices

1. **Start Global, Then Narrow**
   - Test with global announcements first
   - Use CG/role targeting for specific needs

2. **Avoid Over-Targeting**
   - Don't create multiple similar announcements for different groups
   - Consider if a global announcement would work

3. **Role Targeting Examples**
   - SUPER_ADMIN: System changes, technical updates
   - PERSONNEL_CONTACT: Volunteer-related announcements
   - TRADE_TEAM_OVERSEER: Project and crew updates
   - READ_ONLY: General information only

## Troubleshooting

### Announcement Not Showing
- Check that **Active** is enabled
- Verify **Start Date** hasn't been set to future
- Confirm **End Date** hasn't passed
- Check **Target Roles** includes the user's role
- Verify **Construction Group** matches user's CG

### Too Many Announcements
- Review and deactivate outdated announcements
- Consolidate similar announcements
- Use end dates to auto-expire temporary notices
- Limit to 2-3 active announcements at once

### Users Missing Important Announcements
- Use URGENT type for critical information
- Avoid announcement fatigue (too many active)
- Keep messages concise and scannable
- Follow up with email for critical items
