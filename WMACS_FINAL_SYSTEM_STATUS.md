## 🎯 ISSUES RESOLVED USING WMACS

### 1. ✅ Projects API Fix:
**Issue**: 500 Internal Server Error  
**Cause**: Missing backend endpoint, incorrect proxy configuration  
**Solution**: Converted to direct database access with Prisma  
**WMACS Protocol**: Used MCP server for credit-aware investigation

### 2. ✅ Trade Teams Page Restoration:
**Issue**: Page showed blank/missing  
**Cause**: Frontend page didn't exist, only API available  
**Solution**: Restored page based on original lib/trade-teams specification  
**WMACS Protocol**: Research Advisor found original module architecture

### 3. ✅ Navigation Menu Fixes:
**Issue**: Trade Teams menu link broken  
**Cause**: Menu pointed to "/" instead of "/trade-teams"  
**Solution**: Fixed navigation routing in ConditionalLayout.tsx  
**WMACS Protocol**: Systematic investigation and mistake recording

### 4. ✅ Dashboard Landing Page:
**Issue**: Dashboard menu item broken  
**Cause**: Complex component dependencies and TypeScript errors  
**Solution**: Created simple, functional landing page with real stats  
**WMACS Protocol**: Simplified architecture following WMACS guidelines

### 5. ✅ Deployment Issues:
**Issue**: Staging not reflecting latest code changes  
**Cause**: Local changes preventing git pull  
**Solution**: Clean deployment with MCP server operations  
**WMACS Protocol**: Used MCP server for credit-aware deployment
