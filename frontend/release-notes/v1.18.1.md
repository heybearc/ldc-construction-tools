# Release Notes - Version 1.18.1

**Release Date:** December 26, 2024

## 🎨 Branding Improvements

We've refined the application branding for a cleaner, more professional appearance.

### What's New

#### Updated Application Name
- The application is now simply called **"LDC Tools"** (previously "LDC Construction Tools")
- This shorter name appears throughout the application:
  - Header and navigation bar
  - Browser tab title
  - Sign-in page
  - Help documentation
  - Email invitations

#### Simplified Sign-In Page
- Removed the region designation from the sign-in page
- Region information now only appears inside the application based on your assigned region
- Cleaner, more professional first impression

### Why This Change?

These branding improvements make the application:
- **More concise** - Shorter, cleaner name that's easier to remember
- **More scalable** - Ready for multi-region deployment without hardcoded region information
- **More professional** - Streamlined branding consistent across all touchpoints

### What Stays the Same

- All functionality remains unchanged
- Your login credentials work exactly as before
- All features and workflows are identical
- The beautiful Kingdom Hall logo remains

---

**No action required** - these are purely visual improvements that enhance the overall user experience.
