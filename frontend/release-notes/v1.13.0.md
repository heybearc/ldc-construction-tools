## ✨ New Feature: Volunteer Organizational Roles

We're excited to introduce a powerful new way to track and manage volunteer responsibilities beyond their trade team assignments!

### 📋 What's New

**Multiple Role Assignments**
Volunteers can now be assigned multiple organizational roles, making it easy to track regional coordinators, project staff, and Construction Group leadership positions all in one place.

**What you can do:**
- Assign volunteers to regional roles (Field Reps, Design Contacts, Housing Contacts, etc.)
- Track project-specific assignments (Project Staffing Contacts, Safety Coordinators, etc.)
- Identify Construction Group leadership (CGO, ACGO, CG Support)
- Mark primary vs. secondary roles
- Link roles to specific teams, crews, or projects

**How to use it:**
1. Go to the **Volunteers** page
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on any volunteer
3. Scroll to the **"Organizational Roles"** section
4. Click **"Add Role"** to assign a new role
5. Select the role category and specific role
6. Optionally link to a team, crew, or project
7. Mark as primary role if it's their main responsibility

### 🎨 Visual Role Identification

**Color-Coded Badges**
Roles are now displayed with color-coded badges for quick identification:
- 🟣 **Purple** - CG Oversight (CGO, ACGO, CG Support)
- 🔵 **Blue** - Construction Staff (CFR, FR, Design, Housing, Safety, etc.)
- 🟢 **Green** - Trade Team roles (TTO, TTOA, TT Support)
- 🟠 **Amber** - Trade Crew roles (TCO, TCOA, TC Support)
- 🟣 **Indigo** - Project Staff (PSC, PCC, Safety Coordinator, etc.)

**Primary Role Indicator**
Roles marked as "primary" display a star (★) so you can quickly identify each volunteer's main responsibility.

**Compact Display**
- In grid view: See up to 3 roles per volunteer
- In list view: See up to 2 roles per volunteer
