title: User-Volunteer Linking & Bulk Import Enhancements
description: Connect user accounts to volunteer records and import volunteers with organizational roles
---

## ✨ New Features

- **User-Volunteer Account Linking** - You can now link user accounts to volunteer records. When linked, you'll see a blue "User" badge on the Volunteers page and a purple "Volunteer" badge on the Users page, making it easy to identify who has system access.

- **Enhanced Bulk Import** - Import volunteers from CSV files with their organizational roles automatically assigned. The system supports both new and legacy CSV formats for backward compatibility.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Add Volunteer Modal Updates** - The add volunteer form now includes an option to link a user account and supports the new organizational roles system.

- **Better Visual Indicators** - Linked accounts are clearly marked with colored badges throughout the system for easy identification.

## 📝 Notes

This release makes it easier to manage volunteers who also have user accounts in the system, and streamlines the bulk import process for adding multiple volunteers at once.
