## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Navigation Menu Fixed
The navigation menu now correctly shows "Volunteers" and "Congregations" as separate menu items. Previously, they appeared merged together as "VolunteersCongregations".

### Form Input Focus Fixed
When adding or editing congregations, you can now type normally in all form fields. Previously, the cursor would jump out of the text box after each character, requiring you to click back into the field.

This fix applies to:
- The Congregations management page (Add/Edit Congregation)
- The Project detail page (Add Supporting Congregation modal)
