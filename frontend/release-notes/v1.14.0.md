- **Multiple Organizational Roles** - Volunteers can now hold multiple roles simultaneously across different organizational levels. For example, someone can be both a Trade Crew Overseer and serve on a Regional Support team.

- **192 Role Positions** - The system now supports the complete organizational structure with all Construction Group, Trade Team, Trade Crew, and Regional Support positions.

## ✨ New Features

- **Phone Number Formatting** - Phone numbers automatically format as you type in the standard (XXX) XXX-XXXX format for consistency.

- **Smart Role Assignment** - When assigning Trade Team or Trade Crew roles, the system automatically shows the relevant teams and crews for selection, making assignments faster and more accurate.

- **Enhanced Volunteer List** - New "Trade Team/Crew" column shows each volunteer's team and crew assignments at a glance.

- **Improved Dashboards** - Trade team and crew detail pages now accurately display volunteers based on their organizational roles, with correct oversight counts and requirements.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Real-Time Updates** - Role changes appear immediately throughout the system without needing to refresh the page.

- **Better Visual Organization** - Role cards display actual team and crew names instead of generic labels, making it clear exactly what position someone holds.

## 📝 Notes

This is a major update that transitions the system from single-role to multi-role management, supporting the complete organizational structure. All existing volunteers and roles have been preserved and enhanced with the new capabilities.
