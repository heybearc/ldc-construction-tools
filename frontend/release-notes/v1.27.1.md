## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Search Box Improvements

We've fixed several issues with the volunteer search functionality to make it work smoothly and naturally.

**What was fixed:**

1. **Search box now keeps focus while you type**
   - Previously, the search box would lose focus after each letter, requiring you to click back in
   - Now you can type continuously without interruption

2. **Multi-word searches work correctly**
   - You can now search for full names like "Amber Allen" without results disappearing
   - The search understands both first and last names together

3. **Smooth, fluid search experience**
   - No more jarring page refreshes while typing
   - Results update smoothly in the background
   - No visual "bounce" or flicker

**How it works now:**

- Type any name (first, last, or full name) and results appear instantly
- Keep typing to narrow down results
- Search box stays focused throughout your entire search
- Works just like search bars on major websites (Google, Amazon, etc.)

**Example:**
- Type "Amber" → See all volunteers named Amber
- Continue typing "Allen" → Results narrow to show Amber Allen
- No need to click back into the search box between words
