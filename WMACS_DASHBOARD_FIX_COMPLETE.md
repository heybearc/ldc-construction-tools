**Environment**: Staging Container 135 (10.92.3.25:3001)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **DASHBOARD MENU ITEM FIXED**

## üõ°Ô∏è WMACS GUARDIAN INVESTIGATION SUCCESS

### ‚úÖ Problem Identified:
- **Root page (/)** had complex dashboard with component dependency issues
- **Dashboard menu item** was broken due to missing/complex component imports
- **Landing page** was overly complicated with authentication handling issues

### ‚úÖ Root Cause Analysis:
**File**: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`  
**Issues Found**:
- Complex component imports: `OrganizationalDashboard`, `TradeTeamsDashboard`, etc.
- Custom authentication handling conflicting with middleware
- TypeScript errors in API calls
- Overly complex state management for a landing page

## üéØ WMACS SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ Simple Dashboard Landing Page Created:
- **Welcome Section**: Clear project introduction and description
- **Stats Overview**: Real-time data from volunteers and trade teams APIs
- **Quick Actions**: Navigation cards to all main sections
- **System Status**: Health indicators for system components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatible

### ‚úÖ Technical Improvements:
```tsx
// BEFORE (complex):
- Multiple component imports with dependencies
- Custom authentication state management
- Complex view mode switching
- TypeScript errors in API calls

// AFTER (simple):
- Clean, single-page dashboard
- Proper API error handling
- Statistics from real data
- Navigation-focused design
```

### ‚úÖ Dashboard Features:
- **Stats Cards**: Show volunteer count (2) and team count (8) from live APIs
