### ✏️ Construction Group Management

Super Admins can now edit and delete Construction Groups directly from the Organization page.

**What you can do:**
- **Edit CG Details** - Update CG codes or names

- **Reactivate CGs** - Restore accidentally deleted CGs
- **Track Changes** - All operations logged in audit logs

**How to use it:**
1. Go to **Admin** → **Organization**
2. Find the Construction Group in the tree
3. Click **Edit** (pencil icon) or **Delete** (trash icon)
4. Confirm your changes

**Important:** Deleting a CG doesn't remove data - it's a soft delete that can be reversed.
