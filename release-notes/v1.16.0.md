description: Personnel Contact roles can now submit crew requests on behalf of volunteers
---

## ✨ New Features

- **Submit Crew Requests on Behalf of Others** - Users with Personnel Contact, Personnel Contact Assistant, or Personnel Contact Support roles can now submit crew requests for other volunteers. This streamlines the request process for personnel coordinators.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Enhanced Authorization System** - The crew request form now checks your organizational roles to determine if you can submit requests on behalf of others. If authorized, you'll see a special section to enter the volunteer's information.

## 📝 Notes

This feature helps Personnel Contact team members manage crew requests more efficiently by allowing them to submit requests for volunteers who may not have system access.
