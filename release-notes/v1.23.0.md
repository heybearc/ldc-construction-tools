## ✨ New Features

### Multi-Tenant Architecture - Construction Group Data Isolation

We've implemented a comprehensive multi-tenant system that ensures proper data isolation between Construction Groups.

**What you can do:**
- Each Construction Group's data is completely separate and secure
- Volunteers, projects, and requests are automatically filtered by your assigned CG
- No risk of accidentally viewing or modifying data from other Construction Groups

**How it works:**
- When you log in, you automatically see only data for your assigned Construction Group
- All pages (Volunteers, Trade Teams, Projects, Manage Requests) respect CG boundaries
- Data security and privacy are maintained across the entire application

### Construction Group Selector for Administrators

SUPER_ADMIN users now have a powerful new tool to manage multiple Construction Groups efficiently.

**What you can do:**
- Switch between different Construction Groups with a single click
- View data from all CGs combined for organization-wide reporting
- Manage volunteers and requests across multiple CGs without separate logins

**How to use it:**
1. Look for the Construction Group dropdown in the top navigation bar
2. Click to see all available Construction Groups
3. Select a specific CG or choose "All CGs" to view everything
4. The page refreshes automatically with the correct data
5. Your selection is saved and persists across pages

**Who can use it:**
- Only SUPER_ADMIN users see the CG Selector
- Regular users automatically see their assigned CG (no action needed)

## 🔒 Security Improvements

### Enhanced Data Isolation

**What was improved:**
- All API endpoints now enforce Construction Group filtering

- Cross-CG data access is prevented at the system level

**What this means for you:**

- No risk of data leakage between Construction Groups
- Compliance with data privacy requirements
