## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Crew Request "Submit on Behalf Of" Not Working

**What was broken:**
When Personnel Contact Support staff tried to submit crew requests on behalf of other volunteers, the system would ignore their input and use their own name and email instead. This happened even when they correctly filled in the requestor's information.

**How it's fixed:**
- Fixed a technical mismatch that prevented the system from recognizing Personnel Contact Support roles
- Added protection against hidden spaces when copying email addresses from spreadsheets

**What you'll notice:**
If you have Personnel Contact, Personnel Contact Assistant, or Personnel Contact Support roles, you can now successfully submit requests on behalf of others. Just make sure to fill in both the requestor's name AND email address in the "Submit on Behalf Of" section.

## 💡 What You Need to Know

**No action required** - The fix is automatic. Personnel Contact staff can now use the "Submit on Behalf Of" feature as intended.

**Important reminder:** When submitting on behalf of someone else, you must fill in BOTH fields:
- Requestor Name
- Requestor Email

If you only fill in one field, the system will use your own information instead.
