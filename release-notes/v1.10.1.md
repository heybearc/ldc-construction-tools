## ✨ New Features

- **Automatic Release Banners** - When a new version is released, all users will see an attractive announcement banner at the top of the page. The banner includes a link to release notes and can be dismissed with one click. Once dismissed, it won't show again until the next version release.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Better Session Management** - Fixed authentication provider to properly support NextAuth session handling throughout the application.

- **User Profile Tracking** - Added system to track which release version each user has seen, enabling smart banner display logic.

## 📝 Notes

- The release banner appears automatically on login after a version bump
- Clicking the X button dismisses the banner and updates your profile
- The banner will reappear when the next version is released
- This feature works exactly like Theocratic Shift Scheduler's release notification system
