title: Multi-Tenant Organization Hierarchy
description: Introducing organizational structure management with Branch, Zone, Region, and Construction Group hierarchy
---

## ✨ New Features

- **Organization Hierarchy** - New admin page to view and manage your organizational structure (Branch → Zone → Region → Construction Group)
- **Hierarchy Management** - Super Admins can now add new Regions and Construction Groups directly from the Organization page
- **Access Level Indicators** - Clear visual display of your access scope (Full Branch, Zone Level, or Construction Group)

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Simplified User Roles** - Removed the separate "Admin Level" field - your role now determines all access permissions
- **Super Admin Role** - Now visible in the role dropdown when creating or editing users
- **Read Only Role** - Added to role options for users who only need view access
- **Auto-Expanding Tree** - Organization hierarchy automatically expands to show zones and regions with data

## 📝 Notes

- The Organization page is accessible from Admin → Organization in the sidebar
- Only Super Admins can add or modify hierarchy items
- Zone Overseers can view all regions in their zone
- Construction Group users can view their assigned CG only
- Existing users retain their current access - no action required
