## 🐛 Bug Fixes

**What was fixed:**
- Users with Personnel Team roles now see all management buttons they should have access to

- All organizational roles are now properly detected and applied

**Who this affects:**

- Personnel Contact Support
- Other organizational role holders

**What you need to do:**
- If you have an organizational role, you may need to log out and log back in to see the updated permissions
