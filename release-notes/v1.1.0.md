## ✨ New Features

- **Real Audit Logging** - All user actions are now tracked and stored in the database. View login/logout events, user management changes, and system activities in the Audit Logs page.

- **Data Protection with TrueNAS Backups** - Database backups are now automatically created daily at 2 AM and stored on TrueNAS. You can also trigger manual backups from the System Operations page and view a list of recent backups.

- **API Auto-Testing** - The API Status page now automatically tests all endpoints when you load it, giving you instant visibility into system health.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Cleaner Admin Interface** - Removed unnecessary UI elements from the admin header and sidebar for a more focused experience.

- **Professional System Operations Layout** - The System Operations page now displays operations in a clean vertical list format, making it easier to find and run maintenance tasks.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Audit Logs Display** - Resolved an issue where audit logs were not appearing due to missing authentication credentials.

- **Fixed API Route Deployment** - Corrected a configuration issue that prevented certain API routes from being deployed properly.

## 📝 Notes

- Backups are stored at `/mnt/data/ldc-tools-backups/database/automated/` on TrueNAS
- The system keeps the last 30 backups automatically
- Audit logs capture: user logins/logouts, user updates, user deletions, and configuration changes
